Simple File Encryption and Decryption

Project Description:
Create a program in C that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text files using a simple encryption algorithm. You can use techniques like Caesar cipher, substitution cipher, or any other basic encryption method.

Requirements:

Menu System: Create a menu system that allows the user to choose whether they want to encrypt a file, decrypt a file, or exit the program.

File Input/Output: Implement file handling to read the content of a text file, perform encryption/decryption, and save the result back to a file.

Encryption Algorithm: Implement a simple encryption algorithm to modify the content of the text file. For instance, you could shift the characters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet for a basic Caesar cipher. You can explore more complex algorithms if you're comfortable.

Decryption Algorithm: Implement the reverse process of the encryption algorithm to decrypt the encrypted file back to its original form.

User Input: Allow the user to input the file names and encryption/decryption keys (if applicable) from the console.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling. For example, handle situations where the input file does not exist or when there are issues with file operations.

Example (Caesar Cipher):

For a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3:

Input: "HELLO WORLD"
Encrypted Output: "KHOOR ZRUOG"
Decrypted Output: "HELLO WORLD"
Remember, this project allows for creativity. You can experiment with different encryption techniques and make the program more secure and user-friendly.

Feel free to expand on this basic idea and add more features if you're feeling ambitious, such as handling different types of files (images, documents), implementing more complex encryption algorithms, or creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program. Good luck with your project!
