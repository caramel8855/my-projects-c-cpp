Project: File Compression and Decompression Tool
Project Description:

Create a program in C that can compress and decompress files using a simple compression algorithm. The program should be able to take a file as input, compress it to reduce its size, and then decompress it back to the original form.

Features:

Compression Algorithm: Implement a basic compression algorithm (for example, Run-Length Encoding, Huffman Coding, or a simple dictionary-based approach) to reduce the size of the input file.

User Interface: Design a command-line interface where users can specify whether they want to compress or decompress a file, and provide the necessary input/output file paths.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to deal with cases where the input file doesn't exist, or there are issues during file operations.

Progress Indicator: Add a progress indicator to show the user the progress of the compression or decompression process, especially for large files.

File Integrity: Ensure that the decompressed file matches the original file to maintain data integrity.

Optional: File Type Recognition: Implement a feature to recognize the type of file being compressed (text, binary, etc.) and adjust the compression algorithm accordingly for better results.

This project will involve data compression techniques, file handling, and algorithm implementation. It's a great way to learn about how compression algorithms work and improve your file manipulation skills in C
